## Disclaimer

Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at the
[Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://www.apache.org/),
sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/).

[Incubation](http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Process_Description.html)
is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.



## Prerequisites

* Java 1.7 or newer (tested with OpenJDK 1.8)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) 3.2.5 or newer (older
  versions probably also work)


# Building

To build, use

    mvn clean install

This will build each module and run their tests.


## Skipping tests

To skip the tests (these can be timeconsuming), use:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests


If you are modifying this source code independent of the
Apache Taverna project, you may not want to run the
[Rat Maven plugin](https://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/)
that enforces Apache headers in every source file - to disable it, try:

    mvn clean install -Drat.skip=true

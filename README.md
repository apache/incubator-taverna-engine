# Apache Taverna Engine

Workflow engine for
[Apache Taverna](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/) (incubating).

The engine executes a Taverna workflow, defined using
[Apache Taverna Language](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/language/).

Note that the engine does not include the
[activity implementations](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-common-activities/)
that actually perform work (e.g. calling a REST service). To
use the engine, use the
[Apache Taverna Command Line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-commandline/)
or [Apache Taverna Server](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-server/).

All Taverna Engine modules are also valid [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org/) bundles,
providing OSGi [Spring services](#spring-services).

## Disclaimer

Apache Taverna is an effort undergoing incubation at the
[Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://www.apache.org/),
sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org/).

[Incubation](http://incubator.apache.org/incubation/Process_Description.html)
is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision-making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.



## Prerequisites

* Java 1.8 or newer (tested with OpenJDK 1.8)
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.html) 3.2.5 or newer (older
  versions probably also work)

This code relies on other
[Apache Taverna modules](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/code/),
which Maven shuold automatically
download from
[Apache's Maven repository](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/maven/);
however you might want to compile these yourself in the below order:

* [taverna-language](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/language/)
* [taverna-osgi](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/osgi/)

Please see the `<properties>` of this [pom.xml](pom.xml) to find the
correct versions to build.

# Building

To build, use

    mvn clean install

This will build each module and run their tests.


## Building on Windows

If you are building on Windows, ensure you unpack this source code
to a folder with a [short path name](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1880321/why-does-the-260-character-path-length-limit-exist-in-windows)
lenght, e.g. `C:\src` - as
Windows has a [limitation on the total path length](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247%28VS.85%29.aspx#maxpath)
which might otherwise
prevent this code from building successfully.


## Skipping tests

To skip the tests (these can be time-consuming), use:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests


If you are modifying this source code independent of the
Apache Taverna project, you may not want to run the
[Rat Maven plugin](https://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/)
that enforces Apache headers in every source file - to disable it, try:

    mvn clean install -Drat.skip=true

# Modules

The Taverna Engine modules are generally
split into `-api` and `-impl`. The `-api` modules contain
Java interfaces, abstract classes, and minimal dependencies while `-impl`
modules contain the corresponding implementation(s).

Thus, the [taverna-common-activities](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-common-activities/)
should only need to depend on the `-api` modules, while the `-impl` are added by the
packaging of the
[taverna-commandline-product](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-commandline/tree/master/taverna-commandline-product).

## Which module does what?

This section shows how different Taverna Engine module are involved when running
a Taverna workflow, e.g. from the
[Apache Taverna Command Line](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-commandline/).

There are two layers of Taverna Engine:

* Apache Taverna Platform provides an outer API for creating and managing workflow runs, potentially remotely.
* Apache Taverna Core (aka `workflowmodel`, formerly `t2.core`) is the orchestrating part of the Taverna Engine. Its [Activity](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/workflowmodel/processor/activity/Activity.html) is implemented by multiple plugins depending on the activity type.

### Preparations

* Load a SCUFL2 [WorkflowBundle](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/container/WorkflowBundle.html)
 from a `.wfbundle` or `.t2flow` file
 using [WorkflowBundleIO](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/io/WorkflowBundleIO.html)
 from [Taverna Language](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/language/).
 + (Optional) Choose a [Workflow](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/container/WorkflowBundle.html#getWorkflows--) to bind
 workflows (usually the
 [main workflow](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/container/WorkflowBundle.html#getMainWorkflow--)).
 + (Optional) Choose a [Profile](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/container/WorkflowBundle.html#getProfiles--) to bind
 workflow implementations. (There is normally only one profile.)
* Create or load a [Bundle](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/robundle/Bundle.html)
 with the expected [inputs](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/core/Workflow.html#getInputPorts--) of the
 [main workflow](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/container/WorkflowBundle.html#getMainWorkflow--) using
 [DataBundles](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/databundle/DataBundles.html)
from [Taverna Language](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/language/).

### Running a workflow

* You must be running within OSGi to support multiple Taverna activities
 and their dependencies, e.g. by using the
 [OsgiLauncher](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-osgi/org/apache/taverna/osgilauncher/OsgiLauncher.html) from [Apache Taverna OSGi](http://taverna.incubator.apache.org/download/osgi/).
 See the [TavernaStarter example](https://github.com/taverna-extras/taverna-starter/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/taverna/osgistarter/TavernaStarter.java)
 for details.
* (Optional) Populate service credentials (username/password)
 to be used by the workflow into the
 [CredentialManager](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/security/credentialmanager/CredentialManager.html) from
 [taverna-credential-manager-api](taverna-credential-manager-api/).
* Use the [RunService](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/run/api/RunService.html) from the [taverna-run-api](taverna-run-api) (discovered as a [Spring service](#spring-services)).
* Use [runService.getExecutionEnvironments()](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/run/api/RunService.html#getExecutionEnvironments-org.apache.taverna.scufl2.api.container.WorkflowBundle-) to find an executer for your workflow bundle or profile.
  + The RunService selects an appropriate
  [ExecutionService](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/api/ExecutionService.html)
    service ([taverna-execution-api](taverna-execution-api)), checking the [Profile](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/container/WorkflowBundle.html#getProfiles--) against the installed [activity types](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/api/ExecutionEnvironment.html#getActivityTypes--) from [common-activities](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-common-activities/) and plugins; discovered by the  [taverna-capability-api](taverna-capability-api).
  + In the Taverna Command Line there is typically only one match, a  [LocalExecutionEnvironment](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/impl/local/LocalExecutionEnvironment.html), representing the  [LocalExecutionService](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/impl/local/LocalExecutionService.html) from [taverna-execution-local](taverna-execution-local).
  + The experimental module [taverna-execution-remote](taverna-execution-remote) aims to execute a workflow on a remote [Taverna Server](http://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-server/) - e.g. for running workflows remotely from Taverna Workbench.
  + The prototype module [taverna-execution-hadoop](taverna-execution-hadoop) is an attempt to execute compatible Taverna workflows as an [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) map-reduce workflow. (This code needs to be updated for newer Hadoop releases.) For details, see the [SCAPE report on feasibility of parallelising preservation processes](http://scape-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SCAPE_D6.1_TUB_V1.2.pdf).
* [Create an execution job](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/api/ExecutionService.html#createExecution-org.apache.taverna.platform.execution.api.ExecutionEnvironment-org.apache.taverna.scufl2.api.container.WorkflowBundle-org.apache.taverna.scufl2.api.core.Workflow-org.apache.taverna.scufl2.api.profiles.Profile-org.apache.taverna.robundle.Bundle-), and provide the `ExecutionEnvironment`, the `WorkflowBundle`, its `Workflow`, `Profile` and data `Bundle` with inputs. A workflow run id `String` is returned for subsequent calls.
  + Typically this creates a [LocalExecution](taverna-execution-local/src/main/java/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/impl/local/LocalExecution.java#L105) instance ([taverna-execution-local](taverna-execution-local)), which converts the
   abstract SCUFL2 [Workflow](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/core/Workflow.html) to an executable
   [Dataflow](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/workflowmodel/Dataflow.html) ([taverna-workflowmodel-api](taverna-workflowmodel-api)) which has corresponding [Processor](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/workflowmodel/Processor.html)s and
   [Activity](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/workflowmodel/processor/activity/Activity.html) implementations from the installed plugins.
   + A [WorkflowInstanceFacade](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/facade/WorkflowInstanceFacade.html) is prepared - the engine's top-level representation of a workflow run.
   + A [LocalExecutionManager](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine/blob/master/taverna-execution-local/src/main/java/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/impl/local/LocalExecutionMonitor.java) is added as a bridge between the Taverna Core engine and the Platform.
* Start the run using [runService.start()](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/run/api/RunService.html#start-java.lang.String-).
  * Input values from the data [Bundle](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/robundle/Bundle.html) are
  [converted](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine/blob/master/taverna-execution-local/src/main/java/org/apache/taverna/platform/execution/impl/local/T2ReferenceConverter.java#L34) to be registered with a
[ReferenceService](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/ReferenceService.html) ([taverna-reference-api](taverna-reference-api)) - as Taverna workflows pass [T2Reference](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/T2Reference.html)s.
  + Values are represented as either a [InlineStringReference](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/impl/external/object/InlineStringReference.html) or [InlineByteArrayReference](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/impl/external/object/InlineByteArrayReference.html), or could be external [HttpReference](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/impl/external/http/HttpReference.html)s or [FileReference](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/impl/external/file/FileReference.html)s ([taverna-reference-types](taverna-reference-types)). These types are recognized by the `Activity` implementations, allowing pass-by-reference
  where supported, with conversion to strings and bytes if needed.
  + Lists, values and references are stored  [in memory](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/impl/InMemoryReferenceSetDao.html).
  + This was previously backed by [Hibernate](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-engine/blob/old/core-pre-incubator-20141219/reference-impl/src/main/java/net/sf/taverna/t2/reference/impl/HibernateReferenceSetDao.java) stored in [Apache Derby](http://db.apache.org/derby/) - this code was removed due to license incompatibility.
  + TODO: Add a different [ReferenceSetDao](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/reference/ReferenceSetDao.html) implementation
    that is backed directly by the platform's [Bundle](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/robundle/Bundle.html)
    (effectively file-based).
* Monitor the [state of the run](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/run/api/RunService.html#getState-java.lang.String-) or
[get](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/run/api/RunService.html#getWorkflowReport-java.lang.String-) the [WorkflowReport](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/WorkflowReport.html) for detailed progress ([taverna-report-api](taverna-report-api)), such as
the [number of jobs completed](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/ProcessorReport.html#getJobsCompleted--) for a given [Processor](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-language/org/apache/taverna/scufl2/api/core/Processor.html).
* Once the workflow is [COMPLETED](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/State.html#COMPLETED)  (and even while it is [RUNNING](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/State.html#RUNNING)), you can
retrieve the  [bundle](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/run/api/RunService.html#getDataBundle-java.lang.String-) containing the output values and intermediate values.
  + To relate intermediate values, you will need to inspect either the
   [WorkflowReport](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/WorkflowReport.html),
  [ProcessorReport](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/ProcessorReport.html) or [ActivityReport](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/ActivityReport.html)s
  to [get the invocations](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/StatusReport.html#getInvocations--), which provide the [inputs](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/Invocation.html#getInputs--)
  and [outputs](https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/javadoc/taverna-engine/org/apache/taverna/platform/report/Invocation.html#getOutputs--) as
  [Path](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html)s within the bundle.


## Spring services

The OSGi services should be
discoverable as [Spring](https://spring.io/) services,
e.g., by adding the following code to
your `META-INF/spring/update-context-osgi.xml`:

```xml

  <beans:beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:beans="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi/spring-osgi.xsd">

  <reference id="executionService" interface="org.apache.taverna.platform.execution.api.ExecutionService"/>
  <reference id="runService" interface="org.apache.taverna.platform.run.api.RunService"/>
  <reference id="credentialManager" interface="org.apache.taverna.security.credentialmanager.CredentialManager" />
  <reference id="databaseConfiguration" interface="org.apache.taverna.configuration.database.DatabaseConfiguration" />
  <reference id="databaseManager" interface="org.apache.taverna.configuration.database.DatabaseManager" />

  </beans:beans>
```

You might want to combine these with the
[Taverna OSGi services](https://github.com/apache/incubator-taverna-osgi/#spring-services).
